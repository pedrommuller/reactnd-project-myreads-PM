This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the skills learned during the course, a template has been provided with a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.

## Installation

This project requires node and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to run, once in the root folder of the application you have to do:

```sh
npm install

```sh
npm start

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

**This project doesn’t assume a Node backend**. The Node installation is only required for Create React App itself which is the CLI used for the project.
